- Fixed error in PyPI integration from v0.8 and updated README.md to include
  PyPI integration.


## [0.8](https://github.com/awickert/gFlex/releases/tag/v0.8) - 2015-03-04

- First fully-functional and error-checked release, and therefore the first
  true non-"pre-release".


## [0.7](https://github.com/awickert/gFlex/releases/tag/0.7) - 2015-01-21

This release may be short-lived, but is the turning point at which work
on gFlex will go from fixing deficiencies to adding new capabilities.
As such, it is receiving version 0.7 (the last version of its parent project,
"Flexure", was 0.6 back in 2012). It now seems to be functional and stable,
and thus this tagged release will be the basis for this stage of the model
to be pulled to @csdms-contrib and @umn-earth-surface.
